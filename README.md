# Hi 👋 I'm Santhiya

I am currently pursuing my final year B.E CSE.  
I am interested in Web Development and Machine Learnning.

I enjoy building full-stack applications using the MERN stack.  
I have also worked on a few AI/ML based projects as part of my learning and academic work.  
I like exploring how AI can be combined with web applications to solve real problems.

### 🐅 Real-Time Wild Animal Detection in Restricted Areas
This project is designed to detect wild animals entering restricted or sensitive areas using real-time video input.
It helps in preventing human-animal conflicts and improves safety.
I worked on object detection techniques to identify animals from live camera footage.

### 🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection System
This project detects whether a driver is feeling sleepy while driving.
It uses computer vision techniques to monitor eye movement and facial features.
The system can alert the driver to prevent accidents caused by drowsiness.

### AI + MERN Integrated Web Application

I created a web application using the MERN stack where I added some AI-based features.  
The application processes user data and gives results based on basic AI logic.
